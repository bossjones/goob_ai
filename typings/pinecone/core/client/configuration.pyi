    Do not edit the class manually.

    :param host: Base url
    :param api_key: Dict to store API key(s).
      Each entry in the dict specifies an API key.
      The dict key is the name of the security scheme in the OAS specification.
      The dict value is the API key secret.
    :param api_key_prefix: Dict to store API prefix (e.g. Bearer)
      The dict key is the name of the security scheme in the OAS specification.
      The dict value is an API key prefix when generating the auth data.
    :param username: Username for HTTP basic authentication
    :param password: Password for HTTP basic authentication
    :param discard_unknown_keys: Boolean value indicating whether to discard
      unknown properties. A server may send a response that includes additional
      properties that are not known by the client in the following scenarios:
      1. The OpenAPI document is incomplete, i.e. it does not match the server
         implementation.
      2. The client was generated using an older version of the OpenAPI document
         and the server has been upgraded since then.
      If a schema in the OpenAPI document defines the additionalProperties attribute,
      then all undeclared properties received by the server are injected into the
      additional properties map. In that case, there are undeclared properties, and
      nothing to discard.
    :param disabled_client_side_validations (string): Comma-separated list of
      JSON schema validation keywords to disable JSON schema structural validation
      rules. The following keywords may be specified: multipleOf, maximum,
      exclusiveMaximum, minimum, exclusiveMinimum, maxLength, minLength, pattern,
      maxItems, minItems.
      By default, the validation is performed for data generated locally by the client
      and data received from the server, independent of any validation performed by
      the server side. If the input data does not satisfy the JSON schema validation
      rules specified in the OpenAPI document, an exception is raised.
      If disabled_client_side_validations is set, structural validation is
      disabled. This can be useful to troubleshoot data validation problem, such as
      when the OpenAPI document validation rules do not match the actual API data
      received by the server.
    :param server_index: Index to servers configuration.
    :param server_variables: Mapping with string values to replace variables in
      templated server configuration. The validation of enums is performed for
      variables with defined enum values before.
    :param server_operation_index: Mapping from operation ID to an index to server
      configuration.
    :param server_operation_variables: Mapping from operation ID to a mapping with
      string values to replace variables in templated server configuration.
      The validation of enums is performed for variables with defined enum values before.
    :param ssl_ca_cert: str - the path to a file of concatenated CA certificates 
      in PEM format

    :Example:

    API Key Authentication Example.
    Given the following security scheme in the OpenAPI specification:
      components:
        securitySchemes:
          cookieAuth:         # name for the security scheme
            type: apiKey
            in: cookie
            name: JSESSIONID  # cookie name

    You can programmatically set the cookie:

conf = pinecone.core.client.Configuration(
    api_key={'cookieAuth': 'abc123'}
    api_key_prefix={'cookieAuth': 'JSESSIONID'}
)

    The following cookie will be added to the HTTP request:
       Cookie: JSESSIONID abc123
