    This is an in-graph tokenizer for GPT2. It should be initialized similarly to other tokenizers, using the
    `from_pretrained()` method. It can also be initialized with the `from_tokenizer()` method, which imports settings
    from an existing standard tokenizer object.

    In-graph tokenizers, unlike other Hugging Face tokenizers, are actually Keras layers and are designed to be run
    when the model is called, rather than during preprocessing. As a result, they have somewhat more limited options
    than standard tokenizer classes. They are most useful when you want to create an end-to-end model that goes
    straight from `tf.string` inputs to outputs.
