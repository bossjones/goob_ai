Text/audio processor class for MusicGen

class MusicgenProcessor(ProcessorMixin):
    r"""
    Constructs a MusicGen processor which wraps an EnCodec feature extractor and a T5 tokenizer into a single processor
    class.

    [`MusicgenProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`EncodecFeatureExtractor`] and [`TTokenizer`]. See
    [`~MusicgenProcessor.__call__`] and [`~MusicgenProcessor.decode`] for more information.

        feature_extractor (`EncodecFeatureExtractor`):
            An instance of [`EncodecFeatureExtractor`]. The feature extractor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`T5Tokenizer`):
            An instance of [`T5Tokenizer`]. The tokenizer is a required input.
