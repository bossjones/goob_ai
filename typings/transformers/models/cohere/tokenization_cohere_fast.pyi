    Construct a Cohere tokenizer. Based on byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This uses notably ByteFallback and NFC normalization.

    ```

    If you want to change the `bos_token` or the `eos_token`, make sure to specify them when initializing the model, or
    call `tokenizer.update_post_processor()` to make sure that the post-processing is correctly done (otherwise the
    values of the first token and final token of an encoded sequence will not be correct). For more details, checkout
    [post-processors] (https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/api/post-processors) documentation.

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer, but since
    the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with `add_prefix_space=True`.

    </Tip>

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should
    refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

        You can override the default template using the `tool_use_template` kwarg but the quality of your results may decrease.

        Args:
            conversation (Union[List[Dict[str, str]], "Conversation"]): A Conversation object or list of dicts
                with "role" and "content" keys, representing the chat history so far.
            tools (List[Dict]): a list of tools to render into the prompt for the model to choose from.
                See an example at the bottom of the docstring.
                The format should be:
                   * name (str): The name of the tool to be called. Valid names contain only the characters a-z,
                        A-Z, 0-9, _ and must not begin with a digit.
                   * description (str): The description of what the tool does, the model uses the description to
                        choose when and how to call the function.
                   * parameter_definitions (List[Dict]): The input parameters of the tool. Accepts a dictionary
                        where the key is the name of the parameter and the value is the parameter spec.
                        Valid parameter names contain only the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ and must not begin with a digit.
                        Parameter specs are as follows:
                       * description (str): The description of the parameter.
                       * type (str): the type of the parameter - most effective for python builtin data types, such as 'str', 'bool'
                       * required: boolean: Denotes whether the parameter is always present (required) or not. Defaults to not required.
            add_generation_prompt (bool, *optional*): Whether to end the prompt with the token(s) that indicate
                the start of an assistant message. This is useful when you want to generate a response from the model.
                Note that this argument will be passed to the chat template, and so it must be supported in the
                template for this argument to have any effect.
            tokenize (`bool`, defaults to `True`):
                Whether to tokenize the output. If `False`, the output will be a string.
            padding (`bool`, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to pad sequences to the maximum length. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`.
            truncation (`bool`, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to truncate sequences at the maximum length. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`.
            max_length (`int`, *optional*):
                Maximum length (in tokens) to use for padding or truncation. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`. If
                not specified, the tokenizer's `max_length` attribute will be used as a default.
            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors of a particular framework. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`. Acceptable
                values are:
                - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.Tensor` objects.
                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.

                Whether to return a dictionary with named outputs. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`.
            **tokenizer_kwargs: Additional kwargs to pass to the tokenizer.

        Returns:
            `str`: A rendered prompt string.
            or if tokenize=True:
            `List[int]`: A list of token ids representing the tokenized chat so far, including control tokens. This
            output is ready to pass to the model, either directly or via methods like `generate()`.

        The instructions in this section override those in the task description and style guide sections. Don't answer questions that are harmful or immoral.

        # System Preamble
        ## Basic Rules
        You are a powerful conversational AI trained by Cohere to help people. You are augmented by a number of tools, and your job is to use and consume the output of these tools to best help the user. You will see a conversation history between yourself and a user, ending with an utterance from the user. You will then see a specific instruction instructing you what kind of response to generate. When you answer the user's requests, you cite your sources in your answers, according to those instructions.

        # User Preamble
        ## Task and Context
        You help people answer their questions and other requests interactively. You will be asked a very wide array of requests on all kinds of topics. You will be equipped with a wide range of search engines or similar tools to help you, which you use to research your answer. You should focus on serving the user's needs as best you can, which will be wide-ranging.

        ## Style Guide
        Unless the user asks for a different style of answer, you should answer in full sentences, using proper grammar and spelling.

        ## Available Tools

        Secondly, Decide which of the retrieved documents contain facts that should be cited in a good answer to the user's last input by writing 'Cited Documents:' followed a comma-separated list of document numbers. If you dont want to cite any of them, you should instead write 'None'.
        Thirdly, Write 'Answer:' followed by a response to the user's last input in high quality natural english. Use the retrieved documents to help you. Do not insert any citations or grounding markup.
        Finally, Write 'Grounded answer:' followed by a response to the user's last input in high quality natural english. Use the symbols <co: doc> and </co: doc> to indicate when a fact comes from a document in the search result, e.g <co: 0>my fact</co: 0> for a fact from document 0.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>'''
