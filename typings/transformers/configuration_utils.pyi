class PretrainedConfig(PushToHubMixin):
    r"""
    Base class for all configuration classes. Handles a few parameters common to all models' configurations as well as
    methods for loading/downloading/saving configurations.

    <Tip>

    A configuration file can be loaded and saved to disk. Loading the configuration file and using this file to
    initialize a model does **not** load the model weights. It only affects the model's configuration.

    </Tip>

    Class attributes (overridden by derived classes):

    - **model_type** (`str`) -- An identifier for the model type, serialized into the JSON file, and used to recreate
      the correct object in [`~transformers.AutoConfig`].
    - **is_composition** (`bool`) -- Whether the config class is composed of multiple sub-configs. In this case the
      config has to be initialized from two or more configs of type [`~transformers.PretrainedConfig`] like:
      [`~transformers.EncoderDecoderConfig`] or [`~RagConfig`].
    - **keys_to_ignore_at_inference** (`List[str]`) -- A list of keys to ignore by default when looking at dictionary
      outputs of the model during inference.
    - **attribute_map** (`Dict[str, str]`) -- A dict that maps model specific attribute names to the standardized
      naming of attributes.

    Common attributes (present in all subclasses):

    - **vocab_size** (`int`) -- The number of tokens in the vocabulary, which is also the first dimension of the
      embeddings matrix (this attribute may be missing for models that don't have a text modality like ViT).
    - **hidden_size** (`int`) -- The hidden size of the model.
    - **num_attention_heads** (`int`) -- The number of attention heads used in the multi-head attention layers of the
      model.
    - **num_hidden_layers** (`int`) -- The number of blocks in the model.

    Arg:
        name_or_path (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
            Store the string that was passed to [`PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] or
            [`TFPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] as `pretrained_model_name_or_path` if the configuration was created
            with such a method.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the model should return all hidden-states.
        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the model should returns all attentions.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not the model should return a [`~transformers.utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.
        is_encoder_decoder (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the model is used as an encoder/decoder or not.
        is_decoder (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the model is used as decoder or not (in which case it's used as an encoder).
        cross_attention_hidden_size** (`bool`, *optional*):
            The hidden size of the cross-attention layer in case the model is used as a decoder in an encoder-decoder
            setting and the cross-attention hidden dimension differs from `self.config.hidden_size`.
        add_cross_attention (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether cross-attention layers should be added to the model. Note, this option is only relevant for models
            that can be used as decoder models within the [`EncoderDecoderModel`] class, which consists of all models
            in `AUTO_MODELS_FOR_CAUSAL_LM`.
        tie_encoder_decoder (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether all encoder weights should be tied to their equivalent decoder weights. This requires the encoder
            and decoder model to have the exact same parameter names.
        prune_heads (`Dict[int, List[int]]`, *optional*, defaults to `{}`):
            Pruned heads of the model. The keys are the selected layer indices and the associated values, the list of
            heads to prune in said layer.

            For instance `{1: [0, 2], 2: [2, 3]}` will prune heads 0 and 2 on layer 1 and heads 2 and 3 on layer 2.
        chunk_size_feed_forward (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `0`):
            The chunk size of all feed forward layers in the residual attention blocks. A chunk size of `0` means that
            the feed forward layer is not chunked. A chunk size of n means that the feed forward layer processes `n` <
            sequence_length embeddings at a time. For more information on feed forward chunking, see [How does Feed
            Forward Chunking work?](../glossary.html#feed-forward-chunking).

            Flag that will be used by default in the `generate` method of the model. Whether or not to use sampling ;
            use greedy decoding otherwise.
        early_stopping (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):

        num_beams (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Number of beams for beam search that will be used by default in the `generate` method of the model. 1 means
            no beam search.
        num_beam_groups (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Number of groups to divide `num_beams` into in order to ensure diversity among different groups of beams
            that will be used by default in the `generate` method of the model. 1 means no group beam search.
        diversity_penalty (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            Value to control diversity for group beam search. that will be used by default in the `generate` method of
            the model. 0 means no diversity penalty. The higher the penalty, the more diverse are the outputs.
        temperature (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            The value used to module the next token probabilities that will be used by default in the `generate` method
            of the model. Must be strictly positive.
        top_k (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 50):
            Number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering that will be used by default in
            the `generate` method of the model.
        top_p (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Value that will be used by default in the `generate` method of the model for `top_p`. If set to float < 1,
            only the most probable tokens with probabilities that add up to `top_p` or higher are kept for generation.
        typical_p (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Local typicality measures how similar the conditional probability of predicting a target token next is to
            the expected conditional probability of predicting a random token next, given the partial text already
            generated. If set to float < 1, the smallest set of the most locally typical tokens with probabilities that
            add up to `typical_p` or higher are kept for generation. See [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00666.pdf) for more details.
        repetition_penalty (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Parameter for repetition penalty that will be used by default in the `generate` method of the model. 1.0
            means no penalty.
        length_penalty (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Exponential penalty to the length that is used with beam-based generation. It is applied as an exponent to
            the sequence length, which in turn is used to divide the score of the sequence. Since the score is the log
            likelihood of the sequence (i.e. negative), `length_penalty` > 0.0 promotes longer sequences, while
            `length_penalty` < 0.0 encourages shorter sequences.
        no_repeat_ngram_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0) -- Value that will be used by default in the
            `generate` method of the model for `no_repeat_ngram_size`. If set to int > 0, all ngrams of that size can
            only occur once.
        encoder_no_repeat_ngram_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0) -- Value that will be used by
            default in the `generate` method of the model for `encoder_no_repeat_ngram_size`. If set to int > 0, all
            ngrams of that size that occur in the `encoder_input_ids` cannot occur in the `decoder_input_ids`.
        bad_words_ids (`List[int]`, *optional*):
            List of token ids that are not allowed to be generated that will be used by default in the `generate`
            method of the model. In order to get the tokens of the words that should not appear in the generated text,
            use `tokenizer.encode(bad_word, add_prefix_space=True)`.
        num_return_sequences (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Number of independently computed returned sequences for each element in the batch that will be used by
            default in the `generate` method of the model.
        output_scores (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the model should return the logits when used for generation.
        return_dict_in_generate (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the model should return a [`~transformers.utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a `torch.LongTensor`.
        forced_bos_token_id (`int`, *optional*):
            The id of the token to force as the first generated token after the `decoder_start_token_id`. Useful for
            multilingual models like [mBART](../model_doc/mbart) where the first generated token needs to be the target
            language token.
        forced_eos_token_id (`int`, *optional*):
            The id of the token to force as the last generated token when `max_length` is reached.
        remove_invalid_values (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to remove possible _nan_ and _inf_ outputs of the model to prevent the generation method to crash.
            Note that using `remove_invalid_values` can slow down generation.

        > Parameters for fine-tuning tasks

        architectures (`List[str]`, *optional*):
            Model architectures that can be used with the model pretrained weights.
        finetuning_task (`str`, *optional*):
            Name of the task used to fine-tune the model. This can be used when converting from an original (TensorFlow
            or PyTorch) checkpoint.
        id2label (`Dict[int, str]`, *optional*):
            A map from index (for instance prediction index, or target index) to label.
        label2id (`Dict[str, int]`, *optional*): A map from label to index for the model.
        num_labels (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of labels to use in the last layer added to the model, typically for a classification task.
        task_specific_params (`Dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Additional keyword arguments to store for the current task.
        problem_type (`str`, *optional*):
            Problem type for `XxxForSequenceClassification` models. Can be one of `"regression"`,
            `"single_label_classification"` or `"multi_label_classification"`.

        > Parameters linked to the tokenizer

        tokenizer_class (`str`, *optional*):
            The name of the associated tokenizer class to use (if none is set, will use the tokenizer associated to the
            model by default).
        prefix (`str`, *optional*):
            A specific prompt that should be added at the beginning of each text before calling the model.
        bos_token_id (`int`, *optional*): The id of the _beginning-of-stream_ token.
        pad_token_id (`int`, *optional*): The id of the _padding_ token.
        eos_token_id (`int`, *optional*): The id of the _end-of-stream_ token.
        decoder_start_token_id (`int`, *optional*):
            If an encoder-decoder model starts decoding with a different token than _bos_, the id of that token.
        sep_token_id (`int`, *optional*): The id of the _separation_ token.

        > PyTorch specific parameters

        torchscript (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the model should be used with Torchscript.
        tie_word_embeddings (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether the model's input and output word embeddings should be tied. Note that this is only relevant if the
            model has a output word embedding layer.
        torch_dtype (`str`, *optional*):
            The `dtype` of the weights. This attribute can be used to initialize the model to a non-default `dtype`
            (which is normally `float32`) and thus allow for optimal storage allocation. For example, if the saved
            model is `float16`, ideally we want to load it back using the minimal amount of memory needed to load
            `float16` weights. Since the config object is stored in plain text, this attribute contains just the
            floating type string without the `torch.` prefix. For example, for `torch.float16` ``torch_dtype` is the
            `"float16"` string.

            This attribute is currently not being used during model loading time, but this may change in the future
            versions. But we can already start preparing for the future by saving the dtype with save_pretrained.

        > TensorFlow specific parameters

        use_bfloat16 (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the model should use BFloat16 scalars (only used by some TensorFlow models).
        tf_legacy_loss (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the model should use legacy TensorFlow losses. Legacy losses have variable output shapes and may
            not be XLA-compatible. This option is here for backward compatibility and will be removed in Transformers
            v5.

        Instantiate a [`PretrainedConfig`] (or a derived class) from a pretrained model configuration.

        Args:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
                This can be either:

                - a string, the *model id* of a pretrained model configuration hosted inside a model repo on
                  huggingface.co.
                - a path to a *directory* containing a configuration file saved using the

                - a path or url to a saved configuration JSON *file*, e.g., `./my_model_directory/configuration.json`.
            cache_dir (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the

            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force to (re-)download the configuration files and override the cached versions if

                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.` The proxies are used on each request.
            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.

                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>".

                dictionary consisting of the key/value pairs whose keys are not configuration attributes: i.e., the
                part of `kwargs` which has not been used to update `config` and is otherwise ignored.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can

            kwargs (`Dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                The values in kwargs of any keys which are configuration attributes will be used to override the loaded
                values. Behavior concerning key/value pairs whose keys are *not* configuration attributes is controlled
                by the `return_unused_kwargs` keyword parameter.

        Returns:
            [`PretrainedConfig`]: The configuration object instantiated from this pretrained model.
