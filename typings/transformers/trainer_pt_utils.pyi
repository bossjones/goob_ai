    A class responsible for properly gathering tensors (or nested list/tuple of tensors) on the CPU by chunks.

    If our dataset has 16 samples with a batch size of 2 on 3 processes and we gather then transfer on CPU at every
    step, our sampler will generate the following indices:

        `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 0, 1]`

        - P0: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - P1: `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`

        - P1: `[6, 7]`
        - P2: `[12, 13]`

    the following indices:

        `[0, 1, 6, 7, 12, 13]`

    Notes on memory reports:

    In order to get memory usage report you need to install `psutil`. You can do that with `pip install psutil`.

    Now when this method is run, you will see a report that will include: :

    ```
    init_mem_cpu_alloc_delta   =     1301MB
    init_mem_cpu_peaked_delta  =      154MB
    init_mem_gpu_alloc_delta   =      230MB
    init_mem_gpu_peaked_delta  =        0MB
    train_mem_cpu_alloc_delta  =     1345MB
    train_mem_cpu_peaked_delta =        0MB
    train_mem_gpu_alloc_delta  =      693MB
    train_mem_gpu_peaked_delta =        7MB
    ```

    **Understanding the reports:**

    - the first segment, e.g., `train__`, tells you which stage the metrics are for. Reports starting with `init_`
        will be added to the first stage that gets run. So that if only evaluation is run, the memory usage for the
        `__init__` will be reported along with the `eval_` metrics.
    - the third segment, is either `cpu` or `gpu`, tells you whether it's the general RAM or the gpu0 memory
        metric.
    - `*_alloc_delta` - is the difference in the used/allocated memory counter between the end and the start of the
        stage - it can be negative if a function released more memory than it allocated.
    - `*_peaked_delta` - is any extra memory that was consumed and then freed - relative to the current allocated
        memory counter - it is never negative. When you look at the metrics of any stage you add up `alloc_delta` +
        `peaked_delta` and you know how much memory was needed to complete that stage.

    The reporting happens only for process of rank 0 and gpu 0 (if there is a gpu). Typically this is enough since the
    main process does the bulk of work, but it could be not quite so if model parallel is used and then other GPUs may
    use a different amount of gpu memory. This is also not the same under DataParallel where gpu0 may require much more
    memory than the rest since it stores the gradient and optimizer states for all participating GPUS. Perhaps in the
    future these reports will evolve to measure those too.

    The CPU RAM metric measures RSS (Resident Set Size) includes both the memory which is unique to the process and the
    memory shared with other processes. It is important to note that it does not include swapped out memory, so the
    reports could be imprecise.

    The CPU peak memory is measured using a sampling thread. Due to python's GIL it may miss some of the peak memory if
    that thread didn't get a chance to run when the highest memory was used. Therefore this report can be less than
    reality. Using `tracemalloc` would have reported the exact peak memory, but it doesn't report memory allocations
    outside of python. So if some C++ CUDA extension allocated its own memory it won't be reported. And therefore it
    was dropped in favor of the memory sampling approach, which reads the current process memory usage.

    The GPU allocated and peak memory reporting is done with `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` and
    `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()`. This metric reports only "deltas" for pytorch-specific allocations, as
    `torch.cuda` memory management system doesn't track any memory allocated outside of pytorch. For example, the very
    first cuda call typically loads CUDA kernels, which may take from 0.5 to 2GB of GPU memory.

    Note that this tracker doesn't account for memory allocations outside of [`Trainer`]'s `__init__`, `train`,
    `evaluate` and `predict` calls.

    Because `evaluation` calls may happen during `train`, we can't handle nested invocations because
    `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated` is a single counter, so if it gets reset by a nested eval call, `train`'s tracker
    will report incorrect info. If this [pytorch issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/16266) gets resolved
    it will be possible to change this class to be re-entrant. Until then we will only track the outer level of
    `train`, `evaluate` and `predict` methods. Which means that if `eval` is called during `train`, it's the latter
    that will account for its memory usage and that of the former.

    This also means that if any other tool that is used along the [`Trainer`] calls
    `torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats`, the gpu peak memory stats could be invalid. And the [`Trainer`] will disrupt
    the normal behavior of any such tools that rely on calling `torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats` themselves.

    For best performance you may want to consider turning the memory profiling off for production runs.

            in your script multiplied by the number of processes.
        dispatch_batches (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, the dataloader prepared by the Accelerator is only iterated through on the main process
            and then the batches are split and broadcast to each process. Will default to `True` for `DataLoader` whose
            underlying dataset is an `IterableDataset`, `False` otherwise.
        even_batches (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            If set to `True`, in cases where the total batch size across all processes does not exactly divide the
            dataset, samples at the start of the dataset will be duplicated so the batch can be divided equally among
            all workers.
        use_seedable_sampler (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not use a fully seedable random sampler ([`accelerate.data_loader.SeedableRandomSampler`]). Ensures
            training results are fully reproducable using a different sampling technique. While seed-to-seed results
            may differ, on average the differences are neglible when using multiple different seeds to compare. Should
            also be ran with [`~utils.set_seed`] for the best results.
        gradient_accumulation_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*):
            Additional kwargs to configure gradient accumulation, see [`accelerate.utils.GradientAccumulationPlugin`].
            Any of the following (optional) keys are acceptable:
              num_steps (`int`): Will take precedence over [`~.TrainingArguments.gradient_accumulation_steps`] if
                the latter is set to 1, otherwise an exception will be raised.
              adjust_scheduler (`bool`): Whether to adjust the scheduler steps to account for [`~.TrainingArguments.gradient_accumulation_steps`].
                The [`accelerate.utils.GradientAccumulationPlugin`] default is `True`.
              sync_each_batch (`bool`): Whether to synchronize the gradients at each data batch.
                The [`accelerate.utils.GradientAccumulationPlugin`] default is `False`.
