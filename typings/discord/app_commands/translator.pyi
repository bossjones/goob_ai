    Translations are done lazily in order to allow for async enabled translations as well
    as supporting a wide array of translation systems such as :mod:`gettext` and
    `Project Fluent <https://projectfluent.org>`_.

    In order for a translator to be used, it must be set using the :meth:`CommandTree.set_translator`
    method. The translation flow for a string is as follows:

    1. Use :class:`locale_str` instead of :class:`str` in areas of a command you want to be translated.
        - Currently, these are command names, command descriptions, parameter names, parameter descriptions, and choice names.
        - This can also be used inside the :func:`~discord.app_commands.describe` decorator.
    2. Call :meth:`CommandTree.set_translator` to the translator instance that will handle the translations.
    3. Call :meth:`CommandTree.sync`
    4. The library will call :meth:`Translator.translate` on all the relevant strings being translated.

        Translates the given string to the specified locale.

        If the string cannot be translated, ``None`` should be returned.

        The default implementation returns ``None``.

        If an exception is raised in this method, it should inherit from :exc:`TranslationError`.
        If it doesn't, then when this is called the exception will be chained with it instead.

        Parameters
        ------------
        string: :class:`locale_str`
            The string being translated.
        locale: :class:`~discord.Locale`
            The locale being requested for translation.
        context: :class:`TranslationContext`
            The translation context where the string originated from.
            For better type checking ergonomics, the ``TranslationContextTypes``
            type can be used instead to aid with type narrowing. It is functionally
            equivalent to :class:`TranslationContext`.

    :class:`Translator` documentation.

    .. container:: operations

        .. describe:: str(x)

            Returns the message passed to the string.

        .. describe:: x == y

            Checks if the string is equal to another string.

        .. describe:: x != y

            Checks if the string is not equal to another string.

    message: :class:`str`
        The message being translated. Once set, this cannot be changed.

            This must be the default "message" that you send to Discord.
            Discord sends this message back to the library and the library
            uses it to access the data in order to dispatch commands.

            For example, in a command name context, if the command
            name is ``foo`` then the message *must* also be ``foo``.
            For other translation systems that require a message ID such
            as Fluent, consider using a keyword argument to pass it in.
    extras: :class:`dict`
        A dict of user provided extras to attach to the translated string.
        This can be used to add more context, information, or any metadata necessary
        to aid in actually translating the string.

        Since these are passed via keyword arguments, the keys are strings.
