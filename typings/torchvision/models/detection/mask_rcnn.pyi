    Implements Mask R-CNN.

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape [C, H, W], one for each
    image, and should be in 0-1 range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending on if it is in training or evaluation mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors and targets (list of dictionary),
    containing:
        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the ground-truth boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the class label for each ground-truth box
        - masks (UInt8Tensor[N, H, W]): the segmentation binary masks for each instance

    The model returns a Dict[Tensor] during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN, and the mask loss.

    During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a List[Dict[Tensor]], one for each input image. The fields of the Dict are as
    follows:
        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the predicted boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the predicted labels for each image
        - scores (Tensor[N]): the scores or each prediction
        - masks (UInt8Tensor[N, 1, H, W]): the predicted masks for each instance, in 0-1 range. In order to
          obtain the final segmentation masks, the soft masks can be thresholded, generally
          with a value of 0.5 (mask >= 0.5)

    Args:
        backbone (nn.Module): the network used to compute the features for the model.
            It should contain an out_channels attribute, which indicates the number of output
            channels that each feature map has (and it should be the same for all feature maps).
            The backbone should return a single Tensor or and OrderedDict[Tensor].

            considered as negative during training of the RPN.

            for computing the loss
