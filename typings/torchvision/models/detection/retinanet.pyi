class RetinaNet(nn.Module):
    """
    Implements RetinaNet.

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape [C, H, W], one for each
    image, and should be in 0-1 range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending on if it is in training or evaluation mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors and targets (list of dictionary),
    containing:
        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the ground-truth boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the class label for each ground-truth box

    The model returns a Dict[Tensor] during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses.

    During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a List[Dict[Tensor]], one for each input image. The fields of the Dict are as
    follows:
        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the predicted boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the predicted labels for each image
        - scores (Tensor[N]): the scores for each prediction

    Args:
        backbone (nn.Module): the network used to compute the features for the model.
            It should contain an out_channels attribute, which indicates the number of output
            channels that each feature map has (and it should be the same for all feature maps).
            The backbone should return a single Tensor or an OrderedDict[Tensor].
        num_classes (int): number of output classes of the model (including the background).
        min_size (int): minimum size of the image to be rescaled before feeding it to the backbone
        max_size (int): maximum size of the image to be rescaled before feeding it to the backbone
        image_mean (Tuple[float, float, float]): mean values used for input normalization.
            They are generally the mean values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained
            on
        image_std (Tuple[float, float, float]): std values used for input normalization.
            They are generally the std values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained on
        anchor_generator (AnchorGenerator): module that generates the anchors for a set of feature
            maps.
        head (nn.Module): Module run on top of the feature pyramid.
            Defaults to a module containing a classification and regression module.
        score_thresh (float): Score threshold used for postprocessing the detections.
        nms_thresh (float): NMS threshold used for postprocessing the detections.
        detections_per_img (int): Number of best detections to keep after NMS.
        fg_iou_thresh (float): minimum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as positive during training.
        bg_iou_thresh (float): maximum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as negative during training.
        topk_candidates (int): Number of best detections to keep before NMS.

        >>> # so we need to add it here
        >>> backbone.out_channels = 1280
        >>>
        >>> # let's make the network generate 5 x 3 anchors per spatial
        >>> # location, with 5 different sizes and 3 different aspect
        >>> # ratios. We have a Tuple[Tuple[int]] because each feature
        >>> # map could potentially have different sizes and
