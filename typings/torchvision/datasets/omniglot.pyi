        background (bool, optional): If True, creates dataset from the "background" set, otherwise
            creates from the "evaluation" set. This terminology is defined by the authors.

            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``

            target and transforms it.

            puts it in root directory. If the zip files are already downloaded, they are not
