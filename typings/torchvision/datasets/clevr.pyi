    The number of objects in a scene are used as label.

            version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in them target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and puts it in root directory. If
