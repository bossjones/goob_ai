    """`Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) <https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/>`_.

    Args:
        root (str or ``pathlib.Path``): Root directory of the dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, supports ``"train"`` (default), ``"val"``, or ``"test"``.
        partition (int, optional): The dataset partition. Should be ``1 <= partition <= 10``. Defaults to ``1``.

            .. note::

                The partition only changes which split each image belongs to. Thus, regardless of the selected
                partition, combining all splits will result in all images.

        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in a PIL image and returns a transformed
            version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``.
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again. Default is False.
