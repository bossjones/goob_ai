    """`The Country211 Data Set <https://github.com/openai/CLIP/blob/main/data/country211.md>`_ from OpenAI.

    This dataset was built by filtering the images from the YFCC100m dataset
    that have GPS coordinate corresponding to a ISO-3166 country code. The
    dataset is balanced by sampling 150 train images, 50 validation images, and
    100 test images for each country.

    Args:
        root (str or ``pathlib.Path``): Root directory of the dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, supports ``"train"`` (default), ``"valid"`` and ``"test"``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in a PIL image and returns a transformed
            version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``.
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from the internet and puts it into
            ``root/country211/``. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not downloaded again.
