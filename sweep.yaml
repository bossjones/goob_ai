# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests."
  - "Refactor large functions to be more modular."
  - "Add docstrings to all functions and file headers. Use pep257 docstring conventions."
  - "We should use loguru for error logging. If the log is inside an exception, use logger.exception to add tracebacks, where logger is imported from loguru ie. from loguru import logger as LOGGER. Use f-strings for string formatting in logger calls (e.g. LOGGER.info(f'Hello {name}') instead of LOGGER.info('Hello {name}', name=name))."
  # - "There should be no debug log or print statements in production code."
  - "All functions should have parameters and output annotated with type hints. "
  - "Leftover TODOs in the code should be handled."
  - "All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests in the tests/ folder. For example, Write unit tests to the tests directory and mimick the exact struce they use inside of folder src/ ie. if src/goob_ai/utils/writer.py is a python module, the tests should go in tests/utils/test_writer.py. We use pytest for tests. Only use pytest and pytest related plugins."
  - "Any clearly inefficient or repeated code should be optimized or refactored."
  # - "Remove any comments before code that are obvious. For example `# this prints hello world; print('hello world')`."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'main'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: True

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
#
# Example:
#
# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.
description: "bossjones/goob_ai is a python 3.10 project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. All imports should be global (like `import sweepai.utils.github_utils`). Write unit tests to the tests directory and mimick the exact struce they use inside of folder src/ ie. if src/goob_ai/utils/writer.py is a python module, the tests should go in tests/utils/test_writer.py. We use pytest for tests. Never use wildcard imports."


# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
