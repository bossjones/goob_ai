Since the AI Boom, demand for prompt engineers has skyrocketed, with companies like Anthropic offering up to $400,000
for prompt engineers. This article will explain the technical details of prompt engineering and why it's important in
the age of [artificial intelligence](https://www.voiceflow.com/articles/ai-model).

## What Is Prompt Engineering?

**A "prompt" is an instruction or query given to an AI system, typically in**
[**natural language**](http://www.voiceflow.com/articles/natural-language-processing)**, to generate a specific output
or perform a task.**

Prompt engineering is the process of developing and optimizing such prompts to effectively use and guide generative AI
(gen AI) models—particularly [large language models (LLMs)](http://www.voiceflow.com/articles/large-language-models)—to
produce desired outputs.

**Note that prompt engineering is primarily focused on**
[**natural language processing**](http://www.voiceflow.com/articles/natural-language-processing) **(NLP) and
communication rather than traditional maths or engineering.** The core skills involve understanding language, context,
and how to effectively communicate with AI models.

## Prompt Engineering Example

Here's an example of an instruction-based prompt:

You: "Play the role of an experienced Python developer and help me write code."

Then, AI assumes the role of a senior developer and provides the code. In this case, the prompt engineer has given a
specific instruction to the AI, asking it to take on a particular role (experienced Python developer) and perform a task
(help write code).

## Different Types of Prompt Engineering Approaches

**There are 9 types of prompt engineering approaches.** Here's a quick table explaining each approach with an example:

| **Approach**              | **Explanation**                                                               | **Example**                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Zero-shot prompts         | The AI is given a task without any examples or specific instructions.         | "Translate this sentence into Spanish"                                                                                                      |
| Few-shot prompts          | Provide the AI with a few examples to guide its responses.                    | "Translate the following sentences into French: 'Hello, how are you?' becomes 'Bonjour, comment ça va?'. Now translate: 'What time is it?'" |
| Chain-of-thought prompts  | Guide the AI to think step-by-step through a problem.                         | "To solve this math problem, first find the value of x, then calculate y using the value of x."                                             |
| Tree-of-thought prompts   | Encourage the AI to explore multiple branches of reasoning.                   | "List the potential impacts of implementing AI in healthcare, considering both positive and negative effects."                              |
| Instruction-based prompts | Provide the AI with specific instructions or questions for precise responses. | "Write a summary of the latest AI trends."                                                                                                  |
| Example-based prompts     | Offer examples for the AI to follow.                                          | "Here is a summary: \[Insert example\]. Now write a similar summary about AI in healthcare."                                                |
| Context-based prompts     | Give the AI context or background information to generate relevant responses. | "Considering the advancements in AI for autonomous driving, describe the potential impact on urban planning."                               |
| Persona-based prompts     | Instruct the AI to respond as a specific persona or character.                | "As a tech-savvy business consultant, explain the benefits of AI in customer service."                                                      |
| Sequential prompts        | Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps for the AI to follow. | "First, outline the key features of GPT-4. Next, explain how it differs from GPT-3."                                                        |

## Prompt Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. Fine Tuning

**Prompt tuning, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning are all ways to make AI models work better.** Prompt tuning is
about tweaking the questions or instructions given to the AI to get better answers. Prompt engineering involves creating
and refining these questions or instructions in different ways to achieve specific goals. Fine-tuning is more involved,
requiring retraining the AI on new data to make it perform better for specific tasks. All these methods help improve the
AI's ability to provide accurate and relevant responses.

## RAG vs. Prompt Engineering

[**RAG**](http://www.voiceflow.com/articles/retrieval-augmented-generation) **(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines
information retrieval and text generation.** RAG is not just "glorified prompt engineering" because it adds complexity
through the retrieval and integration of external information, such as a
[knowledge base](http://www.voiceflow.com/articles/knowledge-base) (KB), whereas prompt engineering focuses on
optimizing how we interact with the AI model's existing knowledge.

## What's Reverse Prompt Engineering?

**Reverse prompt engineering is the process of figuring out the specific input or prompt that would produce a given
output from an AI model.**

For example, if you have an AI-generated piece of text that describes what a chatbot is, you would work backward to
identify the likely prompt.

## Chatbot Prompt Engineering Best Practices

To prompt engineer chatbots like ChatGPT, follow these best tips:

- **Use role prompting**: Assign a role or persona to the chatbot, such as "You are a creative writing coach". This
    helps frame the conversation and guide the AI model to respond with the correct tone.
- **Provide examples**: Using a "few-shot learning" approach can help the chatbot better understand your request.
- **Use delimiters**: Include triple quotes or brackets to highlight specific parts of your input. This can help the
    chatbot understand the important sections of your prompt.
