# Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

# Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
# conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
# original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
# and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
# following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
# exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

#      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
#      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
#      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
#      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
#      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
#      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
#      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
#      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
#      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
#      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
#      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
#      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
#     wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

#      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
#      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
#      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
#      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
#      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
#      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
#      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
#      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
#      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
#      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
#      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
#      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
#      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
#      respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
#      for the public:

# Section 2 -- Scope.

#   a. License grant.

#        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
#           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
#           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
#           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

#             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
#                in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

#             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
#                NonCommercial purposes only.

#        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
#           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
#           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
#           its terms and conditions.

#        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
#           6(a).

#        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
#           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
#           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
#           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
#           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
#           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
#           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
#           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
#           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
#           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
#           (4) never produces Adapted Material.

#        5. Downstream recipients.

#             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
#                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
#                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
#                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
#                Public License.

#             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
#                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
#                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
#                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
#                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

#             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
#                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
#                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
#                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
#                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
#                Material.

#        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
#           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
#           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
#           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
#           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
#           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

#   b. Other rights.

#        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
#           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
#           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
#           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
#           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
#           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
#           Rights, but not otherwise.

#        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
#           Public License.

#        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
#           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
#           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
#           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
#           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
#           reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
#           the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
#           purposes.


# Section 3 -- License Conditions.

# Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
# following conditions.

#   a. Attribution.

#        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
#           form), You must:

#             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
#                with the Licensed Material:

#                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
#                     Material and any others designated to receive
#                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
#                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
#                     designated);

#                 ii. a copyright notice;

#                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

#                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
#                     warranties;

#                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
#                     extent reasonably practicable;

#             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
#                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

#             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
#                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
#                hyperlink to, this Public License.

#        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
#           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
#           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
#           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
#           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
#           information.
#        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
#           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
#           reasonably practicable.

#   b. ShareAlike.

#      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
#      Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

#        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
#           license with the same License Elements, this version or
#           later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

#        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
#           Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
#           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
#           context in which You Share Adapted Material.

#        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
#           or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
#           Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
#           rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


# Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

# Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
# apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

#   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
#      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
#      portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
#      only;

#   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
#      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
#      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
#      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
#      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

#   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
#      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

# For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
# replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
# Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


# Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

#   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
#      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
#      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
#      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
#      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
#      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
#      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
#      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
#      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
#      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

#   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
#      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
#      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
#      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
#      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
#      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
#      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
#      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
#      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

#   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
#      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
#      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
#      waiver of all liability.


# Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

#   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
#      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
#      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
#      terminate automatically.

#   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
#      Section 6(a), it reinstates:

#        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
#           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
#           violation; or

#        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

#      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
#      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
#      of this Public License.

#   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
#      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
#      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
#      will not terminate this Public License.

#   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
#      License.


# Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

#   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
#      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

#   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
#      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
#      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


# Section 8 -- Interpretation.

#   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
#      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
#      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
#      be made without permission under this Public License.

#   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
#      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
#      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
#      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
#      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
#      conditions.

#   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
#      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
#      Licensor.

#   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
#      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
#      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
#      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
