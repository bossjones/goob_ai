using @http_client.py as context, I want you to create a new Class called AsyncHttpClient. Make sure it has all of the same fuctions that  HttpClient but each one should be async. Add typing annotations to each function or class in side of @http_client.py. Be sure to include return types when necessary. add descriptive docstrings to all functions and classes inside of @http_client.py. Please use pep257 convention, in the style of 'google'. Update existing docstrings if they do not conform to is. Make sure the new AsyncHttpClient is using aiohttp and don't forget to import aiohttp at the top.
